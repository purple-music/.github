### A fullstack SaaS platform for music studio booking

Welcome to the GitHub organization for Purple Music, a real-world application I‚Äôm building to help a friend automate bookings and studio management for their music business. This project has been my main focus since graduating, giving me hands-on experience with fullstack development, system design, and DevOps.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still a work in progress. It is in production, but might be broken. Some components (tests, Storybook) are currently broken but will be updated.
